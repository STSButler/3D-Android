# 3D-Android
<h1>Android: 3D Views</h1>
<p>
This Android app displays 3D scenes. Tap a button to change scenes. Swipe to view.
The project was implemented with Android Studio 2020, Java, OpenGL ES, NDK and XML. 
The project was ported from a WebGL project. The project currently includes just Java, some assets and XML.
</p>
<h2>Efficiency</h2>
<p>
  This app does not use sky boxes with multiple textures. Load <em>one cube mesh</em> for all scenes. Load <em>one texture map</em>, rather than six, for each scene.

You may download the 3D Views app and read the code with explanation at

<h3>Soon</h3>
<p>
I'll upload Gradle and other supporting files soon.
